## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Program
Run `AICoder.exe` (Windows) or `AICoder.app` (macOS) directly.

### 2. Environment Detection
On the first launch, the program performs an environment self-check. If required runtimes (e.g., Node.js) are missing, AICoder will attempt to install them automatically.

### 3. Configure API Key
Select a provider and enter your API Key in the configuration panel for each tool.
*   **Sync Feature**: When you set a Key for a provider in Claude, it will automatically sync to the same provider in Gemini and Codex.
*   If you don't have a Key yet, click the **"Get Key"** button next to the input field to jump to the respective provider's application page.

### 4. Switch and Launch
*   Select your desired AI tool (Claude, Codex, or Gemini) in the left sidebar.
*   **Select Project**: Click a project tab in the "Vibe Coding" area to switch projects.
*   Click **"Launch"**; a terminal window with a pre-configured environment will pop up and run the tool automatically.
