## Core Features

*   **🚀 Automatic Environment Preparation**: Automatically detects and prepares the required AI CLI environments (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Qoder CLI) upon startup, supporting automatic installation and version updates.
*   **🖼️ Unified Sidebar UI**: Features a modern vertical sidebar navigation for quick switching between different AI programming tools.
*   **📢 Message Center (BBS)**: Integrated real-time announcements to keep you updated with the latest tool news, tips, and community announcements.
*   **📚 Interactive Tutorial**: Built-in beginner and advanced guides presented via interactive Markdown to help you master AI programming tools quickly.
*   **🛒 API Store**: Curated list of high-quality API providers accessible with one click to easily resolve model access challenges.
*   **🛠️ Unified Skill Management**:
    *   **Global Skill Repository**: Supports both **Skill ID (Address)** and **Zip Package** formats. Zip skills are added once and shared across all tools.
    *   **Smart Compatibility Check**: Automatically identifies tool capabilities; Gemini/Codex only display and allow installation of Zip skills.
    *   **Built-in System Skills**: Pre-configured official documentation and common toolsets for out-of-the-box use.
*   **📂 Multi-Project Management (Vibe Coding)**：
    *   **Tabbed Interface**: Manage multiple projects simultaneously and switch contexts quickly using tabs.
    *   **Independent Configuration**: Each project can have its own working directory and launch parameters (e.g., Yolo Mode).
    *   **Python Environment Support**: Deeply integrated with Conda/Anaconda, allowing independent Python environments for different projects.
*   **🔄 Multi-Model & Cross-Platform Support**:
    *   Integrated with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Google Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode**, **CodeBuddy**, and **Qoder CLI**.
    *   **"Original" Mode**: One-click switch back to official configurations to ensure a pure tool experience.
    *   **Smart Sync**: API Keys for the same provider are automatically synchronized across different tools.
*   **🖱️ System Tray Support**: Quick model switching, one-click launch, and quitting the application.
*   **⚡ One-Click Launch**: Large buttons to launch the respective CLI tool with pre-configured environments and authentication.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Program
Run `AICoder.exe` (Windows) or `AICoder.app` (macOS) directly.

**Linux TUI Mode**: On Linux, you can use the Terminal User Interface (TUI) mode:
```bash
./AICoder --tui
```
TUI mode provides a lightweight command-line interface to:
- View AI tool installation status
- Configure API Keys
- Manage projects
- Launch AI tools

### 2. Environment Detection
On the first launch, the program performs an environment self-check. If required runtimes (e.g., Node.js) are missing, AICoder will attempt to install them automatically.

### 3. Configure API Key
Select a provider and enter your API Key in the configuration panel for each tool.
*   **Sync Feature**: When you set a Key for a provider in Claude, it will automatically sync to the same provider in Gemini and Codex.
*   If you don't have a Key yet, click the **"Get Key"** button next to the input field to jump to the respective provider's application page.

### 4. Switch and Launch
*   Select your desired AI tool (Claude, Codex, or Gemini) in the left sidebar.
*   **Select Project**: Click a project tab in the "Vibe Coding" area to switch projects.
*   Click **"Launch"**; a terminal window with a pre-configured environment will pop up and run the tool automatically.
